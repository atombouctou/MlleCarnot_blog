The temperature is a physical value which is mesured with a thermometer.

**In daily life**, temperature is linked with the hot and cold sensation. what we are sensing are temperatures differences between our body and the exterior environment.
If there is a temperature difference, then there is a thermal transfer. The hotter element will become colder, and the colder one hotter.

**In physics**, we know that particles which compose a material system are never in an immobile state. The more they move, the more there is friction between them, and so the more there is an important dissipation of thermal energy.

In fact temperature is a physical value which define this thermal dissipation and consequently it is an indirect mesure of molecular agitation of a system.
