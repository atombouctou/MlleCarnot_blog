I take currently mechanical studies. I am passionate about energetics.
I am interrested in improving and optimizing systems, processes and things in general.

Here, I want to present you differents things that I make (DIYcreations).
But I want also to highlight the beauty of heat science and thermodynamics.
My goal is to show you **connections** between things and concepts.

On this, Have a good reading.
